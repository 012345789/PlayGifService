This is a wrapper service for calling the GiphyService API
==========================================================

To install dependencies for this service, run "sh install.sh"
It will install packages and this part requires user input to grant permissions to install/update/overwrite packages

To run the service, run "sh start.sh"
This will start the application on port 8080.
If running the service on a VM with limited memory, you may see an SBT error that looks like `/root/spark/build/sbt-launch-lib.bash: line 72: 2404 Killed "$@"`
This most likely means there was a memory leak in the VM.
Restarting the VM will allow you to run the start script.
